## Starting the Server

1. **Install Live Server Extension**:

   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Search for "Live Server" and install the extension.

2. **Launch the Server**:

   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
   - Click the "Go Live" button located in the bottom right corner of the window.
   - Alternatively, you can run the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     http-server
     ```
     This command assumes you have installed Live Server globally. If not, you can install it using npm: `npm install -g live-server`.

   This will start a local server, and the application will be accessible.

## User Authentication

To fully utilize the application's features, such as signing in, earning badges, tracking activity, posting comments, and participating in discussions, you will need to authenticate your session.

1. **Run the Authenticator**:

   - Execute the `authenticator.py` script. This can be done by opening a terminal, navigating to the directory containing `authenticator.py`, and running the command:
     ```bash
     python authenticator.py
     ```

2. **Log In**:
   - Use one of the following username-password combinations to log in:
     - **Username**: User123 | **Password**: Pass123
     - **Username**: User456 | **Password**: Pass456
     - **Username**: User789 | **Password**: Pass789

Once logged in, you can explore all the interactive features the application offers, such as earning badges for activity in the discussions, tracking your progress, and engaging with the community through comments and discussions.
